                            <h3>How far in advance should I book my session?</h3>
                            <p> I recommend booking at least 4 weeks in advance to ensure availability, especially during peak seasons (spring and fall). However, late-season sessions are always welcome, so don't hesitate to reach out!</p>

                                Repeated cancellations may require a deposit to secure future bookings.</p>
